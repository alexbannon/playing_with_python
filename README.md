# Questions

- Why did you choose this subject?

I chose python for many reasons, one of which being that it's widely used, but also because I had heard that the language was designed to be easy to read, which interested me.

- How were you first made aware of it?

I've seen it in action widely around the web and among fellow programmers. Finally decided to give it a go.

- What problem does it solve and how does it solve it?

From what I can gather so far, it minimizes some of the pain of lengthy code to do relatively simply operations. The reliance on whitespace is definitely new to me, but not difficult to pick up due to indentation being a basic requirement of good code quality.

- Why does one use it?

Why does one use any language? To build stuff and do it efficiently!

- What are the alternatives?

Every other language on the planet, more or less, but there are times when python would definitely be useful over others. For example, it's clean use of import seems pretty valuable.

- What is it similar to, if anything?

Honestly I find it pretty similar to ruby. The code was clearly designed with general readability in mind. Ruby, too, focused less on the required lengthy code and more about functionality.

- What is the history of this technology?

Python was started in 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI. Guido van Rossum was given the title Benevolent Dictator for Life by the community who appreciates his continued involvement with the language. As it evolved, python has brought on a sort of motto - that there should be one obvious way of doing things (and only one).

- Who is maintaining it?

Python is maintained by the community but organized under the Python Software Foundation which tracks issues and fixes and updates.

- What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?

I think python is actually a very interesting language so far and I look forward to playing around with it on many future projects.

- What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?

There were some immediate hurdles. String interpolation and integrated variables using %s %f %d threw me off at first. Also, calling functions before and after variables was tricky - is it len(x) or x.len() - why isn't it both? What is happening? So far it seems that a method call in dot notation is done solely on strings, ie "whatever".upper()

- What resources do you recommend for interested students?

Codecademy's tutorial is good, but basic at first - maybe do the first couple exercises of the first 5 or so stages before you actually dive deep into it. http://www.learnpython.org/ and the python docs - https://docs.python.org/3/ are both obviously necessary.

- What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?

I relied on all three of the above listed items - after running through codecademy I turned to the docs and tutorials on getting things up and running.

- What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?

I think I hit on some of the big ones - create fizzbuzz (first repo I did in python), what makes python different from other languages, and describe a situation where you'd prefer python to another language.

# How to Run

All you need for these is the python interepreter built into osx and linux (and I believe windows) and a text editor (I use atom, occasionally sublime, and rarely vim or emacs if I'm trying to do something very quick and easily.

That's it! I'll include more complex instructions once I have more complex examples.
